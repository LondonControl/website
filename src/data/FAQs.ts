    question:
      'Does London Control allow me to co-ordinate traffic with other sectors and units?',
    answer:
      "Yes, the system includes a very sophisticated co-ordination function. Each flight must be co-ordinated into and out of the sector being controlled. Many of these co-ordinations are automatic, as 'standing agreements' are used to reduce the workload of contorllers.",

  {
    question:
      'How does London Control enable one person to carry out both the planning and tactical controller roles at the same time?',
    answer:
      'Althought the system is highly realistic in the way it supports the different controller roles, some simplifications have been included so that one person can do the entire job of controlling one sector. The advanced tools help with this consdierably. It is also possible to set the system into a mode where coordination is no longer required, so the planning task is reduced to almost nothing.',

  {
    question:
      'The system seems to run very slowly, what can I do to improve performance?',
    answer:
      'There are a number of options that can be set-up in the User Preferences to reduce the processing requirement of the system. These include: switching off MTCA and STCA, setting the Scan Segments to a low number, switching off vector lines and halos, not using radio communication.',
